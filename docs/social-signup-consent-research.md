## Practical Consent Items Applied in Signup Flow

- Required:
  - Age 14+ confirmation
  - Service terms agreement
  - Personal data collection/use agreement
  - Privacy policy confirmation
- Optional:
  - Marketing information opt-in

## Why These Were Selected

- PIPA requires clear notice and consent handling for personal data processing.
- Underage handling requires special care for minors, so explicit age confirmation is collected.
- Google/Apple policies require transparent disclosure and privacy policy availability for account-based apps.
- Marketing consent is separated as optional to keep required consent minimal and compliant.
